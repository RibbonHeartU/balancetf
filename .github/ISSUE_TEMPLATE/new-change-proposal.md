name: New Change Proposal
about: Template for suggesting new changes to an item.

---

Some general rules should be followed when crafting an idea for a balance change to ensure that it results in an interesting and fun item.

* Is it fun both to use, and to play against? The answer to both should be yes.
* Imagine a scenario in which you are playing an organized game of TF2. You're playing the class that equips the item you're changing.
    * Would you think "I have to use this item if I want to win?"
    * Would you think "I can't use this item if I want to win?"
    * If the answer to either of the above questions is yes, it's not a good change.
* Would the mechanics of the item be random/unpredictable in nature? If yes, it's probably not a good change.
* The item should be sufficiently different from others in its slot to be interesting. Just swapping around statistics is probably not going to achieve this.
