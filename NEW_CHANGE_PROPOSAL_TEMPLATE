If not, copy everything from "# Item Name"

# Item Name

The item's current statistics. Grab any you can find from the TF wiki and organize them into tables like below.
Some common rows are created for you.
Your table doesn't have to look perfect here as long as it's valid markdown, but it'd be nice if it was.

| Misc               |         |
|--------------------|--------:|
| Hitscan/Projectile |       ? |
| Ranged/Melee       |       ? |
| Effect             |       ? |

| Damage    |        |

| Type      |      ? |
