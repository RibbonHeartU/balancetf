If you're editing a file that already has proposed changes in it, only copy "## Disputed Change #x" and all lines below it.
If not, copy everything from "# Item Name"

Some general rules should be followed when crafting an idea for a balance change to ensure that it results in an interesting and fun item.

* Is it fun both to use, and to play against? The answer to both should be yes.
* Imagine a scenario in which you are playing an organized game of TF2. You're playing the class that equips the item you're changing.
    * Would you think "I have to use this item if I want to win?"
    * Would you think "I can't use this item if I want to win?"
    * If the answer to either of the above questions is yes, it's not a good change.
* Would the mechanics of the item be random/unpredictable in nature? If yes, it's probably not a good change.
* The item should be sufficiently different from others in its slot to be interesting. Just swapping around statistics is probably not going to achieve this.

# Item Name

The item's current statistics. Grab any you can find from the TF wiki and organize them into tables like below.
Some common rows are created for you.
Your table doesn't have to look perfect here as long as it's valid markdown, but it'd be nice if it was.

| Misc               |         |
|--------------------|--------:|
| Hitscan/Projectile |       ? |
| Ranged/Melee       |       ? |
| Effect             |       ? |

| Damage    |        |
|-----------|-------:|
| Type      |      ? |
| Base      |      ? |
| Crit      |      ? |
| Mini-crit |      ? |

| Function Times  |      |
|-----------------|-----:|
| Attack Interval |    ? |
